# My Calendar Project

This is a simple calendar I made while learning web development.

## What It Does

- Shows the current month and year
- You can click arrows to go to next or previous month
- Today's date is highlighted
- Shows all days in a nice grid

## What I Used

- HTML for the page structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for making it interactive

## What I Learned

- How to work with dates in JavaScript
- How to create elements dynamically
- How to use CSS Grid for layouts
- How to handle button clicks
- How to update content without refreshing the page

## How to Use

- Open index.html in your browser
- Use the < and > buttons to change months
- Today's date will be circled

## Files

- index.html - The main page
- style.css - All the styles and colors
- script.js - The JavaScript code that makes it work

This project helped me understand how to build something interactive from scratch!

# Emphasis and Importance in the text

## The main rule:

**Semantics is more important than appearance.** Choose tags based on their meaning, not their appearance.

## When to use what

### `<em>` - (emphasis)
- When does the *meaning* of a sentence change. 
- An example: "I am **very** glad" vs "I am very **glad**".
- The screen reader changes the intonation.

### `<strong>` - (importants) 
- Critical information.
- Example: "Liquid **is highly toxic**".
- Warnings, key points.

### `<i>`, `<b>`, and `<u>` - (only in special cases)
`<i>` — scientific names, foreign words, terms.
`<b>` — keywords, product names, lead sentences.
`<u>` — spelling errors (rare, better not to use).
